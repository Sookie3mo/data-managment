2. Element nodes with text node children will be converted to JSON key/value pairs. => {"Element":"text node"}
3. Element nodes with element children => {"Element":{"Element":"text node"} }
4. Element nodes with two or more children elements which shared the same node name will be gathered into a JSON array.
5. Children elements in the same level will be separated by ",".
